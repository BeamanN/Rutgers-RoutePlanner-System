Project Problem #6 - Rutgers RoutePlanner System: \
You've been asked to help the Rutgers Department of Transportation
(DoT) to design a student bus route management system. The DoT wants a system
that meets certain performance criteria, e.g., frequency, cost, the maximum time to destination etc. You will need to make sensible necessary assumptions of the budget, the time between campuses, frequency etc., but no student should have to wait more than 30 minutes to get to a class on any campus from any point on the New Brunswic campus.
